To see how the code works, you need to have a project interpreter (file->settings->project->project interpreter). One possibility would be
anaconda. You also need to add the python file to the configuration which is found on the top right side of the screen in PyCharm. The code
might take a little time to run, so even if there are red warning lines let the code run. In the end there will be a file from matplotlib
that will show the input data, actual answer, and predicted answer. Everytime you close that window a new image will appear as performed in
this code.
